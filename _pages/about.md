At the end of January 2025 I got the official ETH nomination to spend the fall semester of this year at the University of Toronto. I am incredible greatful for this opportunity. To document and share my experiences, lessons, and whatever else comes my way, I decided to set up a blog.

Until I will actually leave for Toronto, I will only post irregular updates to the state of planing.

Thanks for reading!
