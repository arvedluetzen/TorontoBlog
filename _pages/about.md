At the end of January 2025 I got the official ETH nomination to spend the fall semester of this year at the University of Toronto. I am incredible greatful for this opportunity. To document and share my experiences, lessons, and whatever else comes my way, I decided to set up a blog.

I am generally publishing each Sunday evening (Toronto Time). If you want to get reminded, just write me and I will put you on the mailing list.

Thanks for reading!
